# how to use
easy as balls, get the config_example.json, (optionally copy) rename it to config.json, fill in the ip, slap that bitch into GUI or CLI folders depending on which you wanna use, and just run the exe's, it will print the server player count every 2.5 seconds.





everything i make is mostly made by gpt because i'm lazy. still useful though and i will still use the mit license because you don't have to persuade bots into doing illegal things
